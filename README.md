# Ethereum-Oracle-with-Smart-Contract
An Oracle created to retrieve the 'Price' and the 'Volume' of any 'Stock'. 

#Instructions 
- First run 'truffle develop' in the 'Contract' directory.
- Run 'truffle compile' and 'truffle migrate'
- copy the JSON file in the 'Contract/build' folder called 'StockOracle.json' into the 'src' folder found in the root of the directory.
- This will update any required changes regarding the new contract adress and the contract ABI.
- Once this is done, you should be able to to run 'npm start' in the root, which will start the web interface. 

#Web Interface Instructions 
- You can use the searchbox to find any specific stock you like
- Once you add the stock, you will be able to retrieve the the price and the volume of the stock you have added.

PS: the API has limits for how many stocks can be added every minute, so you may have to wait a few seconds if you add too many and get an alert stating the stock was not added. 

Hope you like it!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
